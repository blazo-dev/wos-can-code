          Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with
          meaning. It focuses on the relationship between signifies—like
          words, phrases, signs—and what they stand for.

        The word “semantics” comes from the Greek word <em>semantikos</em>,
        meaning “significant.” It was first used in the late 19th century to
        refer to the science of meaning in language.
